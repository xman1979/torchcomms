torchcomms
==========

**torchcomms** is an experimental, lightweight communication API for PyTorch Distributed (PTD).
It provides a simplified, object-oriented interface for distributed collective operations with multiple
out-of-the-box backends, including Meta's production-tested **NCCLX** backend that powers all generative AI services.

Why torchcomms?
---------------

torchcomms addresses several key challenges in distributed PyTorch training:

* **Simplified API**: Clean, object-oriented interface that abstracts away low-level communication details
* **Backend Flexibility**: Easily switch between different communication backends (NCCLX, RCCLX, NCCL, RCCL, Gloo) without changing your code
* **Production-Ready**: NCCLX backend is battle-tested in Meta's production environments powering large-scale AI workloads
* **Type Safety**: Full type hints and validation for better development experience
* **Performance**: Optimized implementations with support for GPU-accelerated communication

Key Features
------------

Multiple Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

torchcomms supports several communication backends out of the box:

* **NCCLX**: Meta's enhanced NCCL implementation with additional optimizations
* **RCCLX**: Meta's enhanced RCCL implementation with additional optimizations
* **NCCL**: NVIDIA's Collective Communications Library for multi-GPU communication
* **RCCL**: AMD ROCm Collective Communications Library for AMD GPUs
* **XCCL**: Intel's Collective Communications Library for Intel GPUs
* **Gloo**: Facebook's collective communications library for both CPU and GPU

Comprehensive Collective Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All standard distributed operations are supported:

* AllReduce, ReduceScatter, AllGather
* Broadcast, Reduce, Scatter, Gather
* Send, Recv for point-to-point communication
* Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations

Flexible Group Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create and manage process groups with ease:

* Initialize groups with different backends
* Support for sub-groups and hierarchical communication patterns
* Automatic resource management and cleanup
