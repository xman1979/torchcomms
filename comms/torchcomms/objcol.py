    Scatters picklable objects in ``scatter_object_input_list`` to the whole comm.

    Similar to :func:`scatter`, but Python objects can be passed in. On
    each rank, the scattered object will be stored as the first element of
    ``scatter_object_output_list``. Note that all objects in
    ``scatter_object_input_list`` must be picklable in order to be scattered.

    Args:
        comm: The comm to work on.
        scatter_object_output_list (List[object]): Non-empty list whose first
            element will store the object scattered to this rank.
        scatter_object_input_list (List[object], optional): List of input objects to scatter.
            Each object must be picklable. Only objects on the ``root`` rank will
            be scattered, and the argument can be ``None`` for non-root ranks.
        root (int): Source rank from which to scatter ``scatter_object_input_list``.
        timeout: (timedelta, optional): Timeout for collective operations. If
            ``None``, will use the default timeout for the backend.
        weights_only (bool, optional): If ``True``, only safe objects such as
            weights are allowed to be deserialized.
            https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html#weights-only

    Returns:
        ``None``. If rank is part of the comm, ``scatter_object_output_list``
        will have its first element set to the scattered object for this rank.

    .. note:: Note that this API differs slightly from the scatter collective
        since it does not provide an ``async_op`` handle and thus will be a
        blocking call.

    .. warning::
        Object collectives have a number of serious performance and scalability
        limitations.  See :ref:`object_collectives` for details.

    .. warning::
        :func:`scatter_object_list` uses ``pickle`` module implicitly, which
        is known to be insecure. It is possible to construct malicious pickle
        data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Only call this
        function with data you trust.

    .. warning::
        Calling :func:`scatter_object_list` with GPU tensors is not well supported
        and inefficient as it incurs GPU -> CPU transfer since tensors would be
        pickled. Please consider using :func:`scatter` instead.
