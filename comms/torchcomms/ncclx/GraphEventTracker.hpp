// CUDA graph capture turns each collective into a recorded node; the normal
// eager-mode watchdog cannot monitor them.  GraphEventTracker solves this by
// taking ownership of each collective's start/end CUDA events and polling
// them from the watchdog thread.
//
// Replay detection: a single-thread GPU kernel node atomically increments a
// per-graph counter in mapped pinned memory on every replay, so the watchdog
// can distinguish "not yet replayed" from "stuck during a replay" without
// the CPU round-trip cost of a host-function callback.
//
// Cleanup: a CUDA user-object callback sets a released flag when the graph
// is destroyed.  The watchdog's next checkAll() call sees the flag and
// destroys the owned events (deferred cleanup model — callbacks never call
// CUDA APIs directly).
//
// Timeout-detection state machine (per collective, per replay):
//
//   start_event  end_event   → state
//   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   COMPLETED    COMPLETED   → OK (reset timer)
//   NOT REACHED  NOT REACHED → no replay in progress (reset timer)
//   COMPLETED    NOT REACHED → IN PROGRESS (start / continue timer)
//   NOT REACHED  COMPLETED   → impossible (would indicate a bug)
//
// The timer is also reset whenever a new replay is detected, preventing
// false timeouts that would span multiple replays.
