Device-initiated AlltoAllv Dynamic implementation using TorchComms Triton APIs.

This module provides GPU-initiated alltoallv collectives with DYNAMIC per-rank
counts that perform all-to-all communication with variable message sizes
directly from Triton kernels without CPU involvement.

Simplified Wrapper (Recommended)
--------------------------------
For most users, the ``AlltoallvOp`` wrapper provides a much simpler,
token-level API that handles buffer registration and iteration tracking
automatically (no offset exchange needed due to fixed-slot layout)::

    from comms.pipes.collectives.triton import AlltoallvOp

    op = AlltoallvOp(comm, max_input_tokens=1024, D=4096,
                     dtype=torch.bfloat16, device="cuda:0")
    with op:
        output = op.alltoallv(input_tensor, output_split_sizes,
                              input_split_sizes)

See ``AlltoallvOp`` for full documentation.

Key Feature: GPU-Resident Counts
---------------------------------
Unlike traditional CPU-initiated alltoallv where send counts must be known on
the host before launch, this implementation reads send/receive counts directly
from GPU memory. This enables:

1. Fused compute + communication: A preceding kernel can compute how much data
   to send to each peer, store counts in GPU memory, and this kernel reads them
   directly - no CPU roundtrip needed.

2. Dynamic workloads: Supports workloads where message sizes are data-dependent
   (e.g., sparse operations, filtering, load balancing, MoE token routing).

3. Zero CPU involvement: The entire compute→count→communicate pipeline stays
   on GPU, eliminating synchronization overhead.

Raw API Usage (Advanced):
    # 1. Compute phase (preceding kernel computes variable counts)
    compute_kernel[grid](data, send_counts_gpu, send_offsets_gpu)

    # 2. Communication phase (reads counts from GPU, no CPU copy)
    device_alltoallv_dynamic(
        send_buf, recv_buf,
        send_counts_gpu,    # GPU tensor - read directly by kernel
        send_offsets_gpu,   # GPU tensor - read directly by kernel
        recv_counts_gpu,
        recv_offsets_gpu,

    Device-initiated AlltoAllv Dynamic kernel.

    Key Feature: Reads send counts and offsets directly from GPU memory,
    enabling fused compute + communication without CPU involvement.

    Algorithm:
    1. Load phase: Read per-peer counts/offsets from GPU memory
    2. Send phase: Put data to all peers using per-peer dst_offsets
    3. Flush phase: Wait for all outgoing transfers to complete
    4. Completion: Coordinate multi-block signaling (if BLOCKS_PER_PEER > 1)
    5. Receive phase: Wait for signals from all peers

    Grid layout: (world_size * BLOCKS_PER_PEER + world_size,) total blocks.
    The first (world_size * BLOCKS_PER_PEER) blocks are SEND blocks.
    The last world_size blocks are RECV blocks (one per peer).

    Send blocks (pid < world_size * BLOCKS_PER_PEER):
        Each peer is served by BLOCKS_PER_PEER consecutive blocks.  When
        BLOCKS_PER_PEER == 1, the kernel behaves identically to the
        single-block-per-peer version.  With BLOCKS_PER_PEER > 1, each
        peer's send data is split into BLOCKS_PER_PEER contiguous chunks
        and each block handles its portion.  Send blocks NEVER call
        wait_signal_from, so they run uninterrupted.

    Recv blocks (pid >= world_size * BLOCKS_PER_PEER):
        Each recv block waits for data from one peer via wait_signal_from.
        These run concurrently with send blocks on separate SMs, fully
        overlapping send and recv.

    Chunked transfer: All transfers use put_block_chunked, which
    distributes CHUNK_SIZE-byte chunks across warps within the block
    using CoopScope::WARP.  This creates multiple concurrent NVLink
    write streams from a single block (one per warp), matching the
    pipes/collectives warp-level architecture.  For messages that fit
    in a single chunk, put_block_chunked falls back to CoopScope::BLOCK
    (equivalent to put_block).  No per-chunk flush is needed — a single
    __syncthreads at the end of put_block_chunked ensures all warps
    complete before the caller signals.

    Signaling:
    - BLOCKS_PER_PEER == 1: The single block calls signal_block after
      put_block_chunked + flush_block.  Release semantics on the signal
      guarantee all prior stores (including all warp-parallel chunks)
      are visible.
    - BLOCKS_PER_PEER > 1: No block signals during puts.  After each
      block completes put_block_chunked + flush_block, it atomically
      increments completion_counters[peer].  The last block to complete
      (atomic result == BLOCKS_PER_PEER - 1) calls signal_block.
      Because flush_block guarantees each block's NVLink writes are
      globally visible before incrementing the counter, the signal is
      only sent after ALL blocks have completed their transfers.

    Args:
        dst_win_ptr: TorchComms device window handle for destination
        src_registered_buf: Device pointer to RegisteredBuffer struct
                           (from register_local_buffer()). Passed directly to
                           put_block_direct / put_warp_chunked_direct which
                           read base_ptr from the struct internally.
        send_offsets_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] - byte offsets into src
        send_sizes_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] - bytes to send per peer
        recv_offsets_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] - byte offsets into local dst
        recv_sizes_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] - bytes expected from each peer
        dst_offsets_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] - byte offsets on each peer's
                        recv_buf (obtained via all_to_all_single exchange)
        my_rank: This rank's ID (constexpr)
        world_size: Total number of ranks (constexpr)
        signal_id: Signal ID to use for notifications (constexpr)
        iteration: 0-based iteration counter (non-constexpr runtime arg).
                   Since put_block increments signals via SignalOp::ADD,
                   the kernel waits for signal >= iteration + 1.
        ELEM_BYTES: Size of each element in bytes (constexpr), e.g. 4 for
                    float32, 2 for float16/bfloat16, 8 for float64.
        BLOCKS_PER_PEER: Number of send blocks assigned to each peer
                         (constexpr). Default: 1 (original behavior).
        CHUNK_SIZE: Chunk size for warp-level distribution in
                    put_block_chunked (constexpr).  Each warp processes
                    chunks of this size in round-robin.  Larger values
                    reduce per-warp overhead; smaller values increase
                    warp-level parallelism.
                    Default: 262144 (256KB).
        completion_counters_ptr: GPU tensor [world_size] of int32 counters
                    (zeroed before each call).  Used for multi-block
                    completion coordination when BLOCKS_PER_PEER > 1.

    Perform device-initiated AlltoAllv with dynamic per-rank counts.

    This is a lean collective with zero host-side overhead — no barriers,
    no torch.cuda.synchronize(), no CUDA allocations, no offset exchange.
    It simply launches the Triton kernel.  All setup (buffer registration,
    offset exchange, get_device_window) is done once by the caller.

    This matches the pipes/collectives and ctran patterns where the
    collective call is just a kernel launch with no per-call overhead.

    Iteration tracking is managed internally — users don't need to create
    or manage iteration tensors. The function auto-increments the iteration
    counter after each call, enabling correct CUDA graph replay behavior.

    Args:
        send_buf: Source tensor containing data to send.
        recv_buf: Destination tensor to receive data into.
        send_sizes: GPU tensor [world_size] with byte counts per peer.
        send_offsets: GPU tensor [world_size] with send buffer offsets.
        recv_sizes: GPU tensor [world_size] with byte counts expected from
                    each peer (used to gate wait_signal_from).
        local_recv_slot_offsets: GPU tensor [world_size] with offsets within
                     "my local" recv buffer where each peer's data lands.
        remote_write_offsets: GPU tensor [world_size] with offsets on "remote
                     peers" recv buffers where I should write (from
                     exchange_offsets()).
        dev_win_ptr: Device window handle (from get_device_window()).
        src_info: Pre-registered send buffer info (from register_local_buffer()).
        my_rank: This rank's ID.
        world_size: Total number of ranks.
        num_warps: Number of warps per block (default: 16, i.e. 512 threads).
                   Controls thread-level parallelism for NVLink memcpy in
                   put_block. Higher values increase copy bandwidth but may
                   reduce occupancy due to register pressure. Valid range:
                   1-32 (CUDA max 1024 threads/block). The pipes AllToAllv
                   benchmarks use 16 warps/block (512 threads) for comparison.
        blocks_per_peer: Number of blocks per peer (default: 1).  With
                         blocks_per_peer > 1, each peer's send data is split
                         into contiguous chunks and each block issues its own
                         put_block — increasing NVLink parallelism for large
                         messages.  Only the last block signals the peer, so
                         the signaling protocol is unchanged.
        sync_buffer: If True (default), enables BUFFER_READY cross-rank
                     synchronization for safe buffer reuse across iterations.
                     This is REQUIRED when using CUDA graphs or replaying
                     multiple iterations without explicit host sync. Adds
                     ~1-3us per-peer latency overhead. Set to False only for
                     microbenchmarking raw kernel throughput.
