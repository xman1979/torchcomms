// 1. The plugin is registered in the colltrace library.
// 2. The following callbacks will be triggered in the colltrace library in
// order:
//    beforeCollKernelScheduled -> afterCollKernelScheduled ->
//    afterCollKernelStart -> [whenCollKernelHang] -> afterCollKernelEnd
// Please note that beforeCollKernelScheduled and afterCollKernelScheduled will
// be triggered in the calling thread, while the rest will be triggered in the
// colltrace thread.
